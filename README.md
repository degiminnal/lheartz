# lheartz

In this work, I created a front-end project called lheartz.  This is a romantic code with a beating heart in the middle of the screen. It has my name and my girlfriend's name on each side. 

## Attention

This project in this version can not fit the screen size properly, which means it can work well only with a screen width equal to or greater than 1920px.
